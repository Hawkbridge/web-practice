				<h2>Boeing says it has Trump deal on Air Force One planes</h2>
				<p>What we might call our culture provides us with an identity and a set of attributes that define that identity. Culture influences what we think, how we feel, how we dress, what and how we eat, how we speak, what values and moral principles we hold, how we interact with one another and how we understand the world around us. Culture pervades almost all aspects of our existence. Perhaps because of this, our own culture is often the taken-for-granted background to everyday life. We may only really become aware of its features when we encounter other cultures or when our own culture is threatened. Culture, like other entrenched systems of norms, may only be revealed to us by intercultural exposure, or by intercultural conflict. The scientific study of culture is entwined with the rise of cultural anthropology in the late nineteenth century. Victorians came to learn of the ways of exotic peoples in books such as The Mind of Primitive Man (1911). Its author was the sociologist Franz Boas who located culture at the centre of social science, defining it as <em>the social habits of a community</em> (Boas, 1930). He also argued that the main contribution of the growing discipline of social psychology should surely be the study of how culture influences people. Hofstedes work (1980, 2001), Cultures Consequences, included a major study of work values that compared forty countries on several value dimensions. One of
                these had opposing anchor points, individualism versus collectivism, which stimulated a large number of cross-cultural studies in the years that followed. The contrast between these reflects whether peoples identity is mostly determined by personal choices or by the collective. In an organisational context, if workers have the freedom to adapt their approach to the job then the ethos of the organisation is individualistic ethos, but if they do not then the ethos is collectivist. Where Hofstedes approach was unique was his argument that the opposing values of individualism and collectivism could be applied to nations, and to cultures, as a whole.
                The scientific study of facial expression has largely focused on the way in which the face communicates emotions. Darwin (1872) believed that there are a small number of universal emotions, and that associated with these are universal facial expressions. Subsequent research generally identified six basic emotions (happiness, surprise, sadness, fear, disgust and anger), from which more complex or blended emotions are derived (Ekman, 1982, 2003; Scherer, 1986).</p>
